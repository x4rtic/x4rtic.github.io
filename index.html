      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm x4rtic, an independent game developer dedicated to creating immersive, systems-driven experiences. As a solo developer, I manage every part of the development processâ€”whether it's programming, designing game mechanics, handling art direction, or building the world. My focus is on crafting deep, interactive systems that allow players to explore, experiment, and engage with the game in meaningful ways. By managing all aspects of the project, I ensure that everything, from the gameplay to the art, aligns with the overall vision and contributes to an experience that feels rich and cohesive.</p>
